## A Chess Question

This is a Python program that will answer a simple question â€“ given a board state that the user enters, with 1 white figure and up to 16 black figures, which black figures can the white figure take?

# Task Requirements

### 1. User Input for White Piece

- The program must prompt the user to input a white piece and its position on the board.
- The user must choose between two predefined piece types (e.g., pawn and rook). -> **I have decided to leave all positions available for choosing** 
- The input format must be: (e.g., knight a5).
- The program must confirm a successful addition or display an error message if the input is invalid.

### 2. User Input for Black Pieces
- After the white piece is set, the user must input the black pieces one by one.
- Each black piece must follow the same format (e.g., bishop d6).
- The user must add at least one and at most sixteen black pieces.
- The user can enter "done" to stop adding black pieces only after at least one black piece has been added.
- The program must confirm a successful addition or display an error message if the input is invalid.

### 3. Input Validation
- The program must ensure that input coordinates follow the correct format (where the letter is a-h and the digit is 1-8, e.g., a1, d4, h8).
- The program must handle edge cases, such as:
- Attempting to enter "done" before adding at least one black piece.
- Providing invalid chess piece names.
- Entering out-of-bounds coordinates.

### 4. Output and Gameplay Logic
- After all pieces are added, the program must display a list of black pieces that the white piece can capture based on valid chess moves.
- If no black pieces are captured, the program should indicate this clearly.
